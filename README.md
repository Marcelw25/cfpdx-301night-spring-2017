# Code 301: Facilitator's Guide

This course guides students through the collaborative process of developing a single page, dynamic web application, using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern.

Using an evolving codebase as the starting point for daily lecture, you will act as the navigator while walking through the previous days assignment(s).  This portion of lecture should facilitate a discussion-based code review that is inviting and engaging, in order to promote class participation.  This will allow students to vocalize on-screen code and improve their development vocabulary.  Students will often have detailed technical questions about the previous day’s assignments, so be sure to familiarize yourself with the codebase regularly.  A typical code review lasts around 30 minutes, but can go much longer. It may be necessary to do upwards of 60-90 minutes of code review if the students are not comprehending the previously assigned lab materials.

The subsequent portion of lecture should be focused on the introduction of new concepts.  Students learn in a variety of different ways so it’s best to start out with a series of (provided) introductory slides.  As you read and discuss each slide, continue to encourage class participation by frequently checking for understanding and reiterating concepts as needed. A real-life story based on your relevant experiences may benefit the class here as well. If the students seem eager to take a deeper dive into any given topic, feel free to perform live code demos, documentation reviews, and whiteboard diagrams as needed. Alternatively, these additions can be reserved for the end of the lecture as a part of preparing students for their next assignment.

Properly preparing students for their daily assignments is a vital part of every day.  To get started, open up the codebase in Atom and walk students through the TODO items defined for that day in the starter code.  Be sure to read through each task description and paraphrase or discuss any confusing terminology.  Depending on the number of TODO items, you can also feel free to work through one (or more) of them in class.  This process should take around 30 minutes but feel free to spend as much time as needed.

Using the concepts and class structure summarized above, you will be ready to prepare students for the next 401 course or job in their career. Be patient, inviting, and passionate throughout the length of your course and it will be a big boost to your overall success. Have fun!

# MVC Overview
## View
The focus of the Views module is teaching students how to understand and construct the view layer of a basic MVC web application. The module begins with an introduction to mobile-first design and development principles, and should include the fundamentals of modular CSS, SMACSS, the box model, positioning, layouts, media queries, and design.  Then, using jQuery and the JavaScript constructor pattern, you will guide students through DOM selection, traversal, manipulation, jQuery events, effects, delegation, and basic code modularity. Later in the Views course content, there will also be discussions of practical applications of typography and HTML templates.

**TODO: Add links to class folder**

## Model
The focus of this week should be on teaching the concepts of a model layer through the use of SQL and a few of its related tools and concepts.  Students will be working with the module design pattern, in conjunction with multiple persistence tools, such as html5sql.js and our own custom abstraction layer, webDB.  These technologies and tools will be used to create a persistence layer, in the browser, that can be accessed dynamically through the use of JavaScript.  Students will focus on using CRUD operations to communicate with the database, along with modular JS patterns and locally sourced JSON data that can be accessed through AJAX.  The primary jQuery AJAX methods used during this week are as follows:** .ajax, .get, .getJSON**.

**TODO: Add links to class folder**

## Controller
The focus of this week is the controller layer of an MVC application.  Through the use of page.js, students will be introduced to client-side routing, deployments and development environments, managing application state, and general OOP based modularity & refactoring.

**TODO: Add links to class folder**
