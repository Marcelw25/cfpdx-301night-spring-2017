### Get your reviews in

### Assignments for this Week

* Read: Handlebars and SMACSS Links [301 N&W - Spring 2017]
* Read: Shay Howe's Intro and Dale Sande's Intro [301 N&W - Spring 2017]
* Read: JS & jQ 293-325 [301 N&W - Spring 2017]

### Portfolios

* For more hands on coding experience, each topic will have a portfolio assignment.
* Portfolios need to be done by individuals, not in groups, although collaboration is encouraged
* Portfolios are due a week after they are assigned. Please do not fall behind!
* The portfolio is a place for you to shine - make it personal, make it original and make it yourself (but keep it simple!)
* The portfolio reinforces skills learned in the pair programming assignment


# Review

### jQuery methods
```
  $myTemplate.find('h1').html('New improved');
  $myTemplate.find('li:first').html(model.mytext);
  $myTemplate.find('li:last').find('a').attr('href', model.mylink);

```

### Chaining

* [link](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_chaining.asp)


### use `live-server`

### Creating our Portfolio repo

* Go into Github
* Create a new Repo `cfpdx-301-portfolio`
* Clone this repo
* Create branches for all your work !

```
git clone https://github.com/kbrumer/cfpdx-301-portfolio
cd cfpdx-301-portfolio
git pull origin master
git checkout -b 02-jQuery-and-DOM
<do some work>
git add .
git commit -m "<my awesome commit message>"
git push origin 02-jQuery-and-DOM
```

When you are satisfied with your work, you will create a PR from your branch to your master repo. This PR link is what you will hand in for the Portfolio assignments.


# Learning Objectives

### jQuery: DOM
* Understand when the jQuery library is useful(and how to include it (local vs CDN)). Why prefer one over another? (CDNs are very fast, no setup required. But you also are relying on them to be up and correct.)
* Perform DOM manipulations, like append, remove, clone, html, text
* Comprehend traversal of the DOM tree, with parents, children, find
* Differentiate between certain methods & the process of chaining (RTFM!)
* Understand `<script>` loading in HTML.

# Lab

1. Driver: fork the CF Lab 02 repository if you haven't done so already.
1. Your **forked repo** on GitHub will be your "origin" repo. Clone **your fork** to your local development environment:
  1. If you haven't done so yet, create a directory named "301" - `mkdir 301/` (This will be your parent 301 directory and set you up for organizational success!)
  1. Next, `cd 301/`
  1. `git clone` this repo.
  1. `cd` into this repo.
  1. Immediately `git checkout -b <driverName-navigatorName>` (ex: `git checkout -b rick-brian`).
