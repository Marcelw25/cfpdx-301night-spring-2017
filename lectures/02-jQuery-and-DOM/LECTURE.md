# Learning Objectives

### jQuery: DOM
* Understand when the jQuery library is useful(and how to include it (local vs CDN)). Why prefer one over another? (CDNs are very fast, no setup required. But you also are relying on them to be up and correct.)
* Perform DOM manipulations, like append, remove, clone, html, text
* Comprehend traversal of the DOM tree, with parents, children, find
* Differentiate between certain methods & the process of chaining (RTFM!)
* Understand `<script>` loading in HTML.
