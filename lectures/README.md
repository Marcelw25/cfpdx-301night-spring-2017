# Lecture Guides
Within each of the class directories you'll find an outline of of the daily Learning Objectives, Readings, and Lecture Topics. Please refer to the guide below for quick reference to a single day's material.

# Demo Lab Code
Within this directory you will see examples of code that already exist, but in snippets that you can pull up, and ready to complete for the class. This assumes you have already removed said portion of the starter-code before working on it with them. Enjoy!
