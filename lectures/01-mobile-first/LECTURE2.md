# Lab

1. Driver: fork the CF Lab 01 repository if you haven't done so already.
1. Your **forked repo** on GitHub will be your "origin" repo. Clone **your fork** to your local development environment:
  1. If you haven't done so yet, create a directory named "301" - `mkdir 301/` (This will be your parent 301 directory and set you up for organizational success!)
  1. Next, `cd 301/`
  1. `git clone` this repo.
  1. `cd` into this repo.
  1. Immediately `git checkout -b <driverName-navigatorName>` (ex: `git checkout -b rick-brian`).
